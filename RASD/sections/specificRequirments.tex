\section{Specific Requirements}
\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
    \subsubsection{User Interfaces}
    This application that we have should be able to receive information about each land and then track the progress of the farmers. We assume that each farmer signs up to our application and then inserts the data of the land, also we receive the forecasts of the meteorological data of Telangana. In these applications, farmers can create discussions and also ask about their problems. Policymakers can observe the farmland and choose the best and worst. There are notifications for farmers about the humidity, the amount of water that the land used, the forecast for weather in the app that helps them to improve their performance. You can see the mock up of our application in the following:

    \subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
    In this system, farmers need to have a smartphone with GPS or a desktop computer that they can, register and add their land to the application and track the changes and also their suggestions. Also, their smartphone should contain a touch screen or keyboard which helps them to start a discussion in the application, ask their questions and share their experiences. The policymaker should also have a smartphone or a desktop computer that login into their account and observe the farmer’s progress in the system. As we just have a mobile application for this program yet, they just need a smartphone.
    \subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
    Our system contains the following interfaces:\\
    Telangana’s map, We’ll use some API that allows us to
\begin{itemize}
    \item Locate the farmlands
    \item Getting information from water irrigation systems
    \item Getting data related to each land from sensors
    \item Getting meteorological information from Telangana’s government
\end{itemize}
The application should receive information about each land and update the data of each profile in real-time.\\
Also, we need push notification services when:
\begin{itemize}
    \item some urgent information change in the servers 
    \item they receive a message from policymakers
    \item someone sends a message in the discussion that they start or join.
\end{itemize}.

    \subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
    The devices connect to DREAM via an internet connection.

    \subsubsection{Scenarios}
 \textbf{General}\\
    Nila is a farmer and as she was a teenager she start working on the land with her father. She starts working every day from 4:00 Am until 7:00 Pm on the land and check all the products qualities, the fertilizers, and the harvest time. So, she downloads this application, inserted the data of her land and the products, the beginning and ending time that she should implement or harvest the products and by using this app she can follow the progress of her land and see if there are some mismatches on the data that she got from the application and the products that she plants.
\newline
\\
\textbf{Ask for Assistant}\\
Aadhya is a middleman farmer who is tired of a new kind of pest last month. After he sold the product of his last harvest and calculated his benefit, he figured out it was negative, and he didn’t have any profit because his last products are attacked by the pests, and he had to pay lots of money to kill them and use more fertilizers to resuscitate the soil so he earn nothing. So, he downloads this application inserted the data of his land and by searching in the discussions he found some useful information from other farmers that had this problem and found a good solution to harness them. So he uses these devices and until now he gets a good result.
\newline
\\
\textbf{Be mechanized}\\
Tom is a farmer who used traditional farming. His son is going to start working with him and he wants to improve the quality of the product and increase their performance. As their land is too wide they need some help, for example, more workers or using some new technologies. He decided to insert some sensors in their land to be more mechanized. These sensors can measure the humidity of the soil and also by using the DREAM application they can insert the data about their products and also track the humidity of their soil and product. Also by using the data that we have from the weather forecast and personalizing suggestions, they decrease the amount of water that they need in irrigation or the number of fertilizers that they need. By using this approach Krishna’s son could increase their performance by about 10\% in just 2 months after using them and he hopes that they can increase the performance by about 20% in the next month.
\newline
\\
\textbf{faster comments}\\
Sarah is a policymaker in Telengana and she tracks the performance and quality of products for about 2 years. Now she figured out there was some aspect that she didn’t consider these years because of the number of farmers and different features that she had to track. Also, most of the comments that she sent for the farmers were useless because she couldn’t track their progress in real-time, and when she sent them because of changes that they had for example changing season most of them wasn’t useful anymore. She didn’t have any platform that shows the progress of a farmer or farmland for a period of time and she had to compare lots of paper things and it is obvious that she drop some points. After she started using DREAM she can observe the progress of farmers faster, send suggestions sooner so she got better results from her observation, and she saw the comments that she send for the farmers are more useful than before.
\newline
\\
\textbf{Best farmer}\\
Krishna one of the policymakers should evaluate the result of the farmers, she wants to know who has the best and worst approaches according to the information registered in the system, she logs in the application with official mail after the authentication, she goes to the rank section and sees the result.
\newline
\\
\textbf{Commenting}\\
Moila is an inexperienced farmer who wants to start farming on her land, she wants to use the experience of others to improve her knowledge so she decided to subscribe to the "how to get a crop from the land" and read the comments also she post her questions 

\newline
\subsection{Performance Requirements-Non-Functional Requirements}
The system should be able to guarantee a safe and consistent connection. Based on the population of Telangana in the worst case, the application should handle about 360,000 users that is the number of Telangana’s farmers. Also because most of the farmers work after the sunrise until the sunset so we must expect some burst in our requests. 
\subsection{Design Constraints - Non-Functional Requirements}
    \subsubsection{Standards compliance}
    The code should follow the requirements contained in this document. Furthermore, its comments should be clear and focused.
    \subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
    The software application requires a mobile device able to capture the position. In alternative, the authorities, can use a computer to observe the progress of the farmers. Both devices can be able to send data to the software via internet connection.
    \subsubsection{Any other constraint}
    The user has the limitation of being the owner of more than one farmland simultaneously.
\subsection{Software System Attributes - Non-Functional Requirements}
    \subsubsection{Reliability and availability}
    The application provides a reliable service in which individual farmers can easily log in and see the data related to their lands. Furthermore, it warranties that the chain of custody of the information coming from the farmers, sensors, and other systems is never broken, and the information is never altered. This would provide a secure and reliable system.
    
    The application must offer availability in the order of 99\% granting with at least 20 hours in a day. The lack of service must be minimal. It’s better to maintain system at nights and before the sunrise because farmers mostly do not use this application at night. Even at night, we could put some resources at sleep mode to reduce the cost of application.
    
    \subsubsection{Security}
    The users’ location and personal data is a very important data and must be encrypted so this part must be more secure than other data stores in the application. Moreover, in case of password recovery this should never be sent in clear. The system must be behind a proxy servers (like cloudflare) to prevent the DDoS attacks
    \subsubsection{Maintainability}
    The application must keep a service log in order to fix bugs more easily. The app should be developed using a micro-service approach, so adding new functions shouldn't’t require to change the previous code, and we can have different instance of services in different time of day. This application needs infrastructure like kubernetes to orchestrate the containers.
    \subsubsection{Portability}
    The user side must be available in different platform like Android, iOS and Web. The back-end side is better to be deployed with docker to easily deploy on any server.
    \subsubsection{Scalability}
    As Climate change continues to be a real and potent threat to the agriculture sector and food demand is expected to increase anywhere, so we will predict that so many farmers will join this app to track their progress, so the system must have a good infrastructure that could balance the loads and easily we must add new resources to it.
\subsection{Additional Specifications}
    \subsubsection{Mandatory Fields}
    At the moment of the registration, an authority will have to compile the following mandatory fields:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Exact location of each farm land
        \item The products that each farmer has in his land
        \item Phone number
        \item Official Email for policymakers
    \end{itemize}
